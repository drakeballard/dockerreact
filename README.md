# Creating A Docker Dashboard

### This application is designed to see which Docker Containers are currently running.

### This application inspired me from an article that I read on a blog on mybridge.co and followed the instructions provided. [MyBridge.co](https://auth0.com/blog/docker-dashboard-with-react-typescript-socketio/?utm_source=mybridge&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=read_more).

### The following technologies are being used:
+ React.js
+ TypeScript
+ Docker


## Please note that this app is not fully functional at this point and some tweeks need to be made.
